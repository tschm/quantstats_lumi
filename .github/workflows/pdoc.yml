name: DOCUMENTATION

# This workflow generates API documentation for the quantstats_lumi package using pdoc.
# pdoc is a tool that automatically creates API documentation from Python docstrings.
# The generated documentation provides a comprehensive reference of all modules, classes, 
# functions, and methods in the package.

# Trigger the workflow on push events
# This ensures the documentation is automatically updated whenever code changes are pushed to any branch
on:
  push

      # Step 4: Install pdoc and generate documentation

      # Step 5: Upload the generated documentation as a workflow artifact
      # This makes the documentation available for download from the GitHub Actions page
      # The artifact is retained for 1 day to save storage space
